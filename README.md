## Honors Project | Using Variational Autoencoders to Generate Novel Music

This repository contains the Google Colab notebook associated with my VAE honors project as well as some of the music generations created from the notebook (found in the generated_samples folder)<br><br><br>
*Disclamer : The Magenta library (especially TensorFlow) generated a lot of warning messages and the audio outputs do not show on the GitHub version of the Google Colab notebook.
