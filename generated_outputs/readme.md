## This folder contains outputs generated from each of the tested models:

1. `mel-cat_2bar` â€” "Melody"
2. `nade-drums_2bar_full` - "Drums"
3. `hierdec-trio_16bar` - "Trio"
4. `hierdec-trio_16bar (self trained)` - "SelfTrain"

### I apologize in advance for the ear damage the self trained model may cause
- I only included 2 of the self trained samples as they literally all sounded like that.
